              <h1>Making Gas Mask</h1>
        </header>
          <h1> Part One</h1>
          <p>
              So First of all I took normal respiraitor and somehow draw lines with black marker on it so I know
              where is the mask too big and where its too small. I cut it out and copied it on cartoon.
              (Im pretty sure copied is wrong word but whatever) cut it out again, than made holes for air filter, sticked it together and added 
              black tape cuz it looks cool.I added some spray paint for it to look even cooler and than I had breakdown.
          </p>
          <h2>Mistakes I made </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The holes for air filters were too far from mouth so they were usless </li>
            <li>In top of the mask there was too much space</li>
           </ul>
           <h1> Part two</h1>
          <p>
              So I had to remake the whole thing bc it was just useless. First I redraw the shape to a paper and I sticked it
              together into the shape I wanted the final thing to look. than I cut it again used the paper thingis as pattern and redraw it 
              on cartoon. cut it, sticked it, taped it with black tape and sprayed it again. I didnt made the holes yet but I will hopefully
              do that in part 3. I cant spell 3. Anyway goodnight! [:
          </p>
          <h1> Part 3</h1>
          <p>
            As I said I cant spell 3. thats why I used number and not a word. Today I made the holes for filters and than I used glue (herkules) to kinda fill
            the coners of the hole if that makes sense? Trus the process. Also Im working on making a video where I expalin more. we will see.
